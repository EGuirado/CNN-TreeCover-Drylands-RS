# CNN-TreeCover-Drylands-RS
Estimating Tree Cover in Drylands with Remote Sensing imagery and Convolutional Neural Networks

The study of Tree cover estimation in drylands with Google Earth imagery was based on Inception v.3 model using Tensorflow(as back-end).

Due to space limitation in Github, the dataset and codes are provided via Google drive [Dataset and code] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uyQf5gp6twbRcYn_pPWSknjYxYY_lKr3?usp=sharing).
